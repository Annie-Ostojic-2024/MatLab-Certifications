% Wrote a program to read the following values from sensor data: pressure, temperature, and flow
% parts that I self-coded are marked below in the code
% MatLab programming udemy course (completed) - Sensor Data Reading Program - written in MatLab
% certification showing passing of the course: https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-648624f2-7971-4ab0-8a53-43b707dd60d5/

clc;

close all;

sensor_select = menu('Select the sensor to read data from','Pressure Sensor', 'Temperature Sensor', 'Flow Sensor');

if sensor_select == 1
  disp('Data from the pressure sensor')
elseif sensor_select == 2
  disp('Data from the temperature sensor')
elseif sensor_select == 3
  disp('Data from the flow sensor')
else
  disp('No sensor is selected')
end

% Output will be an interactive GUI that prompts the user to click on the sensor that is being used
